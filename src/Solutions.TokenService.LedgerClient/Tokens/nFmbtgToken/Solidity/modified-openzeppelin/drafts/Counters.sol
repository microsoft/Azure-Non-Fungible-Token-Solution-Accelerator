/**
 * @title Counters
 * @author Matt Condon (@shrugs)
 * @dev Provides counters that can only be incremented or decremented by one. This can be used e.g. to track the number
 * of elements in a mapping, issuing ERC721 ids, or counting request ids.
 *
 * Include with `using Counters for Counters.Counter;`
 * Since it is not possible to overflow a 256 bit integer with increments of one, `increment` can skip the SafeMath
 * overflow check, thereby saving gas. This does assume however correct usage, in that the underlying `_value` is never
 * directly accessed.
